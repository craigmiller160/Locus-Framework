Locus Framework Version Changelog

Version 1.1
+ Expanded scanning to be either package based or class based. New class based scanning requires full, qualified class names in configuration.
+ Expanded reflective method calls to include add/remove for collection based operations.
+ Code refactoring and improvements.

Version 1.0
+ Created main Locus components: View, Model, Controller, and Debug.
+ Ability to invoke any setter/getter reflectively in views and models.
+ Ability to reflectively retrieve Controller classes.
+ LocusControllerCallback allows the controller to retrieve values from the view without needing a reference to the view.
+ LocusDebug provides handy instant logging to the console, useful for debugging Locus issues and getting a snapshot of the current configuration.
+ Restrictions: Model setters/getters must have unique names. setFoo() cannot exist more than once, even if in separate classes or with different parameters. Views do not have this restriction.
+ XML based configuration, read into memory at framework initialization.
+ Classpath package scanning to detect annotated classes, with package names specified in configuration.
